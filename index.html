                        Shri Lokmanilal, the Founder President of MPVM believed that Education plays a pivotal role in
                        moulding citizens, worthy of taking a nation to glorious heights. He held that schools should
                        bring about holistic development of students under the able guidance of sincere and hardworking
                        teachers. ~ Mr. Lokmanilal

                <h1>MPVM's views</h1>
                "Jnana is knowledge whereas Prajnanam is Supreme knowledge. In other words Knowledge is divine.

                The goal of Maharshi Patanjali Vidya Mandir is to inculcate supreme knowledge in the students.

                Hence MPVM strives for not just Jnana, but Prajnana, to be our better selves, everyday.

                Prajnanam Brahma not only means that knowledge is divine; it also means that there is potential God
                in everyone. Realizing one's intrinsic worth is the mission of MPVM.
                It is often said, “The world is so big; how can I make a difference!” MPVM’s answer is, “To the
                world, you may be a person but to a person, you can be the world.

                Hence each MPVMian shall make a difference in the life of one person and keep a record of the
                progress."
